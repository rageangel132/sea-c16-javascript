            <p>The basic type of Hadoken is a surging punch in which a fighter's willpower is utilized to focus energy into and through the palms. As the palms are thrust outwards towards the target, a surging energy wave is expelled that results in a punching force traveling through the air in the opponent's direction. The user will usually be immobilized for a short time after performing this move, leaving them vulnerable to counterattack.</p>

            <p>Executed by moving the stick forward, down, and then down-forward (commonly referred to as a "Shoryuken motion"), the move is a jumping uppercut in which the user spins and rockets upwards with some horizontal movement as well, knocking the opponent to the ground with much damage.</p>

            <p>It originates from the classic Capcom fighting video game series Street Fighter. The practitioner jumps and, while in the air, rotates his or her legs, kicking the opponent 1~3 times depending on button pressed. It is usually performed by moving the joystick or D-pad a quarter circle backwards the opponent from the down position, then pressing a kick button. The Tatsumaki, in some games, will lift the user high enough to fly over projectiles, such as the Hadoken, Sonic Boom, Soul Spark and Yoga Fire.</p>
